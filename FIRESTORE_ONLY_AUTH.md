# Firestore-Only Authentication Implementation

## Overview

This document explains the changes made to remove Firebase Authentication dependency and implement user authentication using only Firestore database.

## Why This Change?

The previous implementation was creating users in both Firebase Authentication AND Firestore, which was redundant and unnecessary. Since you only want to use Firestore for user management, we've removed the Firebase Auth dependency entirely.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Firebase Service (`services/firebaseService.ts`)

**Removed:**
- All Firebase Authentication imports (`createUserWithEmailAndPassword`, `signInWithEmailAndPassword`, etc.)
- Firebase Auth user creation and management
- `onAuthStateChange` function

**Added:**
- Simple password hashing using `btoa()` (Note: for production, use proper hashing like bcrypt)
- Password verification function
- User lookup by email in Firestore
- Local user ID generation using email hash

**Key Functions Updated:**
- `firebaseSignUp`: Now only creates users in Firestore `users` collection
- `firebaseSignIn`: Authenticates against Firestore data
- `adminSignIn`: Admin authentication using Firestore
- `firebaseSignOut`: Simple logout (no Firebase Auth involved)

### 2. Updated Firebase Configuration Files

**Files Updated:**
- `firebase.ts` - Removed Auth imports and initialization
- `config/firebase.ts` - Removed Auth setup
- `config/firebase.example.ts` - Updated example configuration
- `firebase.js` - Removed Auth from JavaScript version

**Changes:**
- Removed `getAuth` and `initializeAuth` imports
- Removed Auth service initialization
- Updated exports to only include `db`, `storage`, and `analytics`

### 3. Updated Authentication Context (`contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**Removed:**
- Firebase Auth state change listener
- Dependency on `onAuthStateChange`

**Added:**
- Local storage management using AsyncStorage
- Session management with 24-hour expiration
- User state persistence across app restarts
- Manual navigation based on user role

**Key Features:**
- Users stay logged in until session expires (24 hours)
- User data is stored locally for offline access
- Automatic navigation based on user role (admin vs regular user)

## How It Works Now

### User Registration
1. User enters email, password, and name
2. System checks if email already exists in Firestore
3. If not, creates new user document in `users` collection
4. Password is hashed before storage
5. User profile is created with default values
6. User is automatically logged in

### User Login
1. User enters email and password
2. System looks up user by email in Firestore
3. Password is verified against stored hash
4. If valid, user session is created and stored locally
5. User is redirected based on their role

### Session Management
- User sessions are stored locally using AsyncStorage
- Sessions expire after 24 hours
- User data persists across app restarts
- No network calls needed for session validation

## Security Considerations

### Current Implementation
- **Password Hashing**: Basic `btoa()` with salt (NOT production-ready)
- **Session Storage**: Local storage with expiration
- **No JWT**: Simple local session management

### Production Recommendations
1. **Use proper password hashing** (bcrypt, Argon2, or similar)
2. **Implement JWT tokens** for better security
3. **Add rate limiting** for login attempts
4. **Use secure storage** for sensitive data
5. **Implement refresh tokens** for better session management

## Database Structure

### Users Collection
```typescript
interface User {
  id: string;           // Generated from email hash
  email: string;        // User's email address
  password: string;     // Hashed password
  name: string;         // User's display name
  role: 'user' | 'admin' | 'super_user';
  points: number;       // Gamification points
  badge: string;        // User's current badge
  badgeEmoji: string;   // Emoji for badge
  createdAt: Date;      // Account creation date
  lastActive: Date;     // Last activity timestamp
  isActive: boolean;    // Account status
  permissions: string[]; // User permissions
  // ... other profile fields
}
```

### User Activities Collection
- Tracks user actions (login, logout, profile updates)
- Used for analytics and debugging
- Automatically created during user operations

## Migration Notes

### If You Had Existing Users
1. **Firebase Auth Users**: These will no longer work
2. **Firestore Users**: These will continue to work as expected
3. **Password Reset**: Users will need to create new passwords

### Data Migration
If you need to migrate existing Firebase Auth users:
1. Export user data from Firebase Auth
2. Create corresponding documents in Firestore `users` collection
3. Hash passwords using the same method
4. Update user IDs to match the new format

## Testing

### Test Scenarios
1. **New User Registration**: Should create user in Firestore only
2. **User Login**: Should authenticate against Firestore
3. **Session Persistence**: User should stay logged in after app restart
4. **Session Expiration**: User should be logged out after 24 hours
5. **Admin Access**: Admin users should access admin dashboard
6. **Regular Users**: Regular users should access main app

### Debugging
- Check console logs for authentication flow
- Verify Firestore documents are created correctly
- Check AsyncStorage for local session data
- Monitor network requests (should be minimal)

## Benefits

1. **Simplified Architecture**: No dual user management
2. **Reduced Dependencies**: No Firebase Auth SDK needed
3. **Better Control**: Full control over user data and authentication
4. **Offline Capability**: Users can access app without network
5. **Cost Reduction**: No Firebase Auth usage charges

## Limitations

1. **Security**: Basic password hashing (needs improvement)
2. **Session Management**: Simple local storage approach
3. **Password Recovery**: No built-in password reset functionality
4. **Multi-device**: Sessions are device-specific

## Next Steps

1. **Implement proper password hashing** for production
2. **Add password reset functionality**
3. **Implement JWT-based authentication**
4. **Add session refresh mechanism**
5. **Implement proper error handling for network issues**
6. **Add user activity logging and analytics**

## Support

If you encounter any issues with this implementation:
1. Check the console logs for detailed error messages
2. Verify Firestore rules allow read/write access
3. Ensure all imports are updated correctly
4. Check that AsyncStorage is working properly
