# Role-Based Navigation Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Missing Navigation Logic in Authentication Functions**
**Problem**: The login, signup, and admin login functions were setting user state but not handling navigation based on user roles.

**Solution**: Added comprehensive role-based navigation to all authentication functions:
- `login()` - Now navigates users based on their role after successful authentication
- `signup()` - Now navigates new users to main tabs (they always get 'user' role)
- `adminLogin()` - Now navigates admin users to admin dashboard
- Session restoration - Enhanced with better logging and navigation logic

**Files Modified**: `contexts/AuthContext.tsx`

### 2. **Missing NGO Route in Root Layout**
**Problem**: The NGO route `(ngo)` was missing from the root navigation stack, causing navigation failures.

**Solution**: Added the NGO route to the root layout:
```typescript
<Stack.Screen name="(ngo)" options={{ headerShown: false }} />
```

**Files Modified**: `app/_layout.tsx`

### 3. **Missing NGO User Creation Function**
**Problem**: No function existed to create NGO users with proper role and permissions.

**Solution**: Added `createNGOUser()` function to `firebaseService.ts`:
- Creates Firebase Auth user
- Sets role to 'ngo'
- Assigns appropriate NGO permissions
- Creates Firestore document with proper structure

**Files Modified**: `services/firebaseService.ts`

### 4. **Missing User Role Update Function**
**Problem**: Admins couldn't change user roles after creation.

**Solution**: Added `updateUserRole()` function for role management:
- Allows admins to change user roles
- Updates Firestore document
- Maintains audit trail with timestamps

**Files Modified**: `services/firebaseService.ts`

## Navigation Logic Implementation

### Role-Based Routing
```typescript
// Navigation logic implemented in all auth functions
if (userProfile.role === 'admin' || userProfile.role === 'super_user') {
  console.log('üõ°Ô∏è Redirecting admin user to admin dashboard');
  router.replace('/(admin)/dashboard');
} else if (userProfile.role === 'ngo') {
  console.log('üè¢ Redirecting NGO user to NGO dashboard');
  router.replace('/(ngo)/dashboard');
} else {
  console.log('üë§ Redirecting regular user to main tabs');
  router.replace('/(tabs)');
}
```

### User Roles and Destinations
| User Role | Navigation Destination | Description |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------|
| `user` | `/(tabs)` | Regular users go to main app tabs |
| `admin` | `/(admin)/dashboard` | Admin users go to admin dashboard |
| `super_user` | `/(admin)/dashboard` | Super users go to admin dashboard |
| `ngo` | `/(ngo)/dashboard` | NGO users go to NGO dashboard |

## Enhanced Logging

### Navigation Debugging
Added comprehensive logging to track navigation flow:
- Role detection and validation
- Navigation decision making
- Route redirection confirmation
- Session restoration navigation

### Example Log Output
```
üß≠ Navigating user to appropriate dashboard based on role: ngo
üè¢ Redirecting NGO user to NGO dashboard
‚úÖ NGO user created successfully: ngo@example.com
üéâ Login complete! User should now be redirected to main app
```

## Testing Recommendations

### 1. **Test User Signup and Login**
- Create regular user ‚Üí Should navigate to `/(tabs)`
- Verify navigation occurs after successful authentication
- Check console logs for navigation messages

### 2. **Test Admin Login**
- Login with admin credentials ‚Üí Should navigate to `/(admin)/dashboard`
- Verify admin dashboard loads correctly
- Check role-based access controls

### 3. **Test NGO User Creation and Login**
- Create NGO user using `createNGOUser()` function
- Login with NGO credentials ‚Üí Should navigate to `/(ngo)/dashboard`
- Verify NGO dashboard loads with incident reports

### 4. **Test Session Restoration**
- Close and reopen app
- Verify user is automatically navigated to correct dashboard
- Check console logs for session restoration navigation

### 5. **Test Role Changes**
- Use admin interface to change user roles
- Verify navigation updates correctly after role changes
- Test all role transitions (user ‚Üî admin ‚Üî ngo)

## Files Modified Summary

| File | Changes Made |
|------|--------------|
| `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` | Added role-based navigation to login, signup, adminLogin, and session restoration |
| `app/_layout.tsx` | Added missing NGO route to root navigation stack |
| `services/firebaseService.ts` | Added createNGOUser() and updateUserRole() functions |
| `services/firebaseService.ts` | Fixed UserRole import for type safety |

## Next Steps

1. **Test the complete authentication flow** with different user roles
2. **Verify navigation works correctly** for all user types
3. **Monitor console logs** for navigation debugging information
4. **Test edge cases** like role changes and session restoration
5. **Implement additional role-based features** as outlined in `NGO_ROLE_SETUP.md`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Navigation not working**: Check if user role is set correctly in Firestore
- **Route not found**: Verify all routes are properly defined in app structure
- **Permission denied**: Ensure user has correct role and permissions

### Debug Commands
- Check console logs for navigation messages
- Verify user document structure in Firestore
- Test navigation logic with different roles
- Monitor authentication state changes
