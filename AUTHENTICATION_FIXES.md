# Authentication Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Firestore Undefined Values Error
**Problem**: The `firebaseSignUp` function was setting `profileImage: undefined` and other optional fields to `undefined`, which Firestore doesn't allow.

**Solution**: Removed explicit `undefined` assignments for optional fields:
- `profileImage: undefined` â†’ removed (field is optional)
- `phoneNumber: undefined` â†’ removed (field is optional)
- `location.city: undefined` â†’ `location.city: ''` (empty string instead)
- `location.state: undefined` â†’ `location.state: ''` (empty string instead)
- `location.country: undefined` â†’ `location.country: ''` (empty string instead)

**Files Modified**: `services/firebaseService.ts`

### 2. Firebase Auth Persistence Warning
**Problem**: Firebase Auth was initialized without AsyncStorage persistence, causing auth state to not persist between sessions.

**Solution**: Updated Firebase configuration to use React Native persistence:
- Changed from `getAuth(app)` to `initializeAuth(app, { persistence: getReactNativePersistence(AsyncStorage) })`
- Added proper imports for `initializeAuth` and `getReactNativePersistence`

**Files Modified**: `services/firebaseConfig.ts`

### 3. User Profile Recovery Mechanism
**Problem**: When users tried to login but their Firestore document was missing, the app would fail with a generic error.

**Solution**: Added automatic user profile recovery in the `firebaseSignIn` function:
- If a user document is missing, the system now attempts to create a basic profile
- Uses Firebase Auth user data (email, displayName) to populate the profile
- Provides better error handling and user experience

**Files Modified**: `services/firebaseService.ts`

### 4. Improved Error Handling
**Problem**: Generic error messages that didn't help users understand what went wrong.

**Solution**: Added specific error handling for common Firebase Auth errors:
- `auth/email-already-in-use` â†’ "An account with this email already exists. Please try logging in instead."
- `auth/user-not-found` â†’ "No account found with this email address. Please check your email or create a new account."
- `auth/wrong-password` â†’ "Incorrect password. Please try again."
- `auth/invalid-email` â†’ "Please enter a valid email address."
- `auth/weak-password` â†’ "Password is too weak. Please use at least 6 characters."
- `auth/too-many-requests` â†’ "Too many failed login attempts. Please try again later."
- `auth/network-request-failed` â†’ "Network error. Please check your internet connection and try again."

**Files Modified**: 
- `app/login.tsx`
- `app/signup.tsx`
- `app/admin-login.tsx`

## Technical Details

### User Document Structure
The user document now properly handles optional fields:
```typescript
const userData: Omit<User, 'id'> = {
  email: email.toLowerCase(),
  name: name.trim(),
  role: 'user',
  points: 0,
  badge: 'Newcomer',
  badgeEmoji: 'ðŸŒ±',
  createdAt: new Date(),
  lastActive: new Date(),
  isActive: true,
  permissions: ['submit_reports', 'view_own_reports', 'view_leaderboard'],
  location: {
    city: '',        // Empty string instead of undefined
    state: '',       // Empty string instead of undefined
    country: ''      // Empty string instead of undefined
  },
  preferences: {
    notifications: true,
    emailUpdates: true,
    language: 'en'
  }
  // profileImage and phoneNumber are omitted (optional fields)
};
```

### Firebase Configuration
Updated to use proper React Native persistence:
```typescript
export const auth = initializeAuth(app, {
  persistence: getReactNativePersistence(AsyncStorage)
});
```

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test User Signup**: Verify that new users can be created without Firestore errors
2. **Test User Login**: Verify that existing users can login successfully
3. **Test Profile Recovery**: Verify that users with missing profiles can still login (system will recover their profile)
4. **Test Error Handling**: Verify that appropriate error messages are shown for various failure scenarios
5. **Test Persistence**: Verify that auth state persists between app sessions

## Dependencies
- `@react-native-async-storage/async-storage` is already installed and properly configured
- Firebase v12.2.0 is properly configured with the project credentials

## Next Steps
1. Test the authentication flow with the fixes
2. Monitor logs for any remaining issues
3. Consider adding user profile validation and cleanup mechanisms
4. Implement proper user role management for NGO users as outlined in `NGO_ROLE_SETUP.md`
